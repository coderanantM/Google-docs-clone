## Features

- Real-time collaborative text editing  
- Multi-document support  
- Clean and responsive UI  
- Client-side routing  
- Optimized production build  
- Scalable component-based architecture

## Tech Stack

- **React (Create React App)**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **Node.js & npm**
- (Add others if applicable: Socket.IO, Quill, MongoDB, etc.)
